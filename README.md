# MSc-Project-

This project is investigating the use of a number of pattern recognition algorithms on neuroimaging datasets \
Datasets to be used are the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative Dataset as well as imaging from the qMAP-PD cohort https://qmaplab.com/qmap-pd \
Particular focus will be on the role of feature selection and confounds on the performance of the classifiers \
Approaches tested thus far are: SVM, Gaussian Process. TODO Linear Discriminant Analysis, Some deep learning approach \
