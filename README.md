# MSc-Project-

This project is investigating the use of a number of pattern recognition algorithms on neuroimaging datasets \
Datasets to be used are the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative Dataset \
Particular focus will be on the role of feature selection and confounds on the performance of the classifiers \
Methods included are SVM, Gaussian Process Classifier,
